                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>
                        SimuOttawa is a student-led club dedicated to developing SimuO, an open-sourced 3D physics engine that accurately replicates real-life simulations. We're committed to creating cutting-edge tools that bridge the gap between theoretical physics and practical application, enabling researchers and developers to model complex systems with precision.

                    <h2>What We Do</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every year, our team pushes the boundaries of simulation technology by building upon previous iterations and introducing new capabilities. Our members work on diverse roles and projects, from optimizing user experience to expanding the engine's computational power. The result is a versatile platform that can be integrated into real-world product development and scientific research.

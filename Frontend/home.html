        <h2>About SimuO</h2>
        <p class="about-text">
            Our club, SimuOttawa, is dedicated to developing SimuO, an open-sourced, 3D engine that can accurately replicate real-life simulations. Every year, SimuOttawa pushes itself to create a model that is more advanced than anything we have previously made. By doing this, the SimuO program can be used to help develop real-world products. Each member in SimuOttawa is assigned a role to play and a project to complete, aiming to either optimize the user experience or promote SimuO to those who may be interested

        <p class="about-text">
            We provide undergraduate STEM students at uOttawa with many opportunities to improve their understanding of physical concepts while growing their skills in software development and business management. Such skills are crucial to many students who want high-level careers or who are looking to create their own startup. We understand the difficulties of the job market and are looking to provide every member with ways to impress employers during job interviews. Through our club, students learn both high and low-level coding languages like Python and C++, they are also exposed to mathematical concepts often used in 3D game design, and will be given the ability to showcase what they have learned via social media.
